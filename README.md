<!-- About Folder Structure  -->


# 📚 Full Detailed Explanation of Each Folder and File

---

# 🗂 Folder: `app/`
**Main application code lives here.**

It contains:
- All feature modules (users, organizations, tasks, projects)
- Core system files (config, security)
- Database connection setup
- Workers (background jobs)

✅ It **keeps your app code isolated** from Docker configs, readmes, etc.

---

## 📁 `app/users/`
This folder manages **all User-related functionality**:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `api.py` | All API routes related to user (signup, login, get profile, etc.) |
| `models.py` | SQLAlchemy database model for `User` table |
| `schemas.py` | Pydantic request/response models for user APIs (validation) |
| `service.py` | Business logic (e.g., creating users, hashing passwords) |
| `repository.py` | Database queries for users (find by email, insert user) |

✅ **Users** are managed modularly — API, DB, logic, everything inside this folder.

---

## 📁 `app/organizations/`
Same idea as users — but for managing **Organizations**:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `api.py` | APIs like create organization, get organization details |
| `models.py` | Organization SQLAlchemy model |
| `schemas.py` | Pydantic schemas (CreateOrg, OrgOut) |
| `service.py` | Business logic to handle organization registration |
| `repository.py` | Database queries related to organizations |

✅ **Organization** acts as "workspace" for users and projects.

---

## 📁 `app/projects/`
Manages **Projects** (like Trello Boards, Jira Epics):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `api.py` | APIs for project CRUD (create, update, delete projects) |
| `models.py` | Project DB model |
| `schemas.py` | Project request/response validation |
| `service.py` | Project business logic |
| `repository.py` | Project database operations |

✅ **Projects** group tasks under organizations.

---

## 📁 `app/tasks/`
Manages **individual Tasks** inside Projects:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `api.py` | Task APIs (create, assign, update status) |
| `models.py` | Task DB model |
| `schemas.py` | Task create/update schemas |
| `service.py` | Task business logic (e.g., checking if task already assigned) |
| `repository.py` | Task database operations |

✅ **Tasks** are core work units assigned to users inside a project.

---

# 🛠 Core System Folders:

---

## 📁 `app/core/`
This folder contains **global utilities** and **settings** for the app.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config.py` | App settings like DB URL, secret keys, JWT expiry (read from `.env`) |
| `security.py` | Password hashing, JWT token creation and verification |
| `auth.py` | Extra helpers for authenticating users (token decoding, role checking) |

✅ **Keeps security and settings organized**, not mixed with business logic.

---

## 📁 `app/db/`
This folder manages **database setup** and **SQLAlchemy base models**.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `session.py` | Create and export a database session (`SessionLocal`) |
| `base_class.py` | A common base class for all models to inherit from |
| `base.py` | Imports all models at one place for Alembic migrations |

✅ Makes DB connection reusable everywhere in the app.

---

## 📁 `app/db/models/`
**All SQLAlchemy model files** are kept here (if you want strict separation).

Optional right now because we put models inside their feature folders (`users/models.py`, etc.).

---

## 📁 `app/workers/`
This folder will handle **background jobs**.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `reminder_worker.py` | Celery tasks to send deadline reminders, async notifications |

✅ We don’t block API users — heavy jobs handled in background.

---

# 🖥️ Project Root Files

---

## 📄 `main.py`
**Entry point** of the FastAPI application.

- Creates FastAPI app instance.
- Includes all routers (from `api_router.py`).
- Starts the server with Uvicorn.

✅ It’s your application “start button.”

---

## 📄 `api_router.py`
**Combines all API routers** into one place.

Example:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter
from app.users.api import router as user_router
from app.organizations.api import router as org_router

api_router = APIRouter()
api_router.include_router(user_router, prefix="/users", tags=["users"])
api_router.include_router(org_router, prefix="/organizations", tags=["organizations"])
```

✅ Keeps your `main.py` clean and modular.

---

## 📄 `requirements.txt`
List of all your Python dependencies:

Example:

```
fastapi
uvicorn
sqlalchemy
pydantic
alembic
python-dotenv
psycopg2-binary
```

✅ Used to install libraries quickly with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📄 `Dockerfile`
Later, for **containerizing** your app:

- Sets up Python
- Installs dependencies
- Runs the app

✅ Essential for cloud deployments (AWS, GCP, Azure).

---

## 📄 `docker-compose.yml`
Later, for **running app + database (Postgres) + redis** easily together during development.

✅ Essential for local dev environment simulating production.

---

## 📄 `README.md`
Project documentation.

- What your app does
- How to setup
- How to contribute

✅ Good practice for clean developer experience.

---

# 🧠 How Folders/Files Relate to Each Other (Simple Flow)

```
[main.py] --> [api_router.py] --> [users/api.py] (or tasks/api.py etc.)
      ↓
[users/api.py] calls -> [users/service.py]
      ↓
[users/service.py] calls -> [users/repository.py]
      ↓
[users/repository.py] talks to -> [users/models.py] + DB session
      ↓
Schemas (users/schemas.py) validate requests/responses
```

✅ Clean vertical flow inside each feature.

✅ Each feature is fully isolated and independent.

✅ Easy to test, easy to maintain, easy to grow.

# 📢 Final Summary

| Area | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| `users/`, `organizations/`, `projects/`, `tasks/` | Feature-specific functionality |
| `core/` | App settings, security, authentication |
| `db/` | DB connections, base models |
| `workers/` | Background jobs (later) |
| `main.py`, `api_router.py` | Start and route the app |

✅ This architecture is **ready for production-level SaaS apps**.  
✅ You will **practice real-world scalable backend design** from the start.
